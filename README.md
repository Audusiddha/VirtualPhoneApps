# VirtualPhoneApps
This project ‘VIRTUAL PHONE’ helps us to perform few of the basic 
functionalities of a mobile phone. It can mainly be used as a 
substitute of a mobile phone for specific modules. 
Over the internet, if we analyze, we will not get an application like 
this which performs the basic tasks of a phone in desktop 
environment. Keeping this in mind, we are trying to implement an 
application which can do few of the basic tasks very easily. 
It is a simple desktop application without any ads and uses very trial 
API’s for the successful working of the modules. The designing of the 
UI’s have been done with the Qt Designer and the coding part with 
Python3 and the PyQt5 framework for Python.
